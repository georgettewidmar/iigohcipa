I added the network traffic monitor icon to the status bar. I am wondering if there's a way to see what's being uploaded/downloaded, or from which apps is the traffic coming and going. Usually it's obvious since I know from which app I am downloading something but would be great to see a log or some real time traffic viewer. I'm farily new to android btw, so maybe there's an obvious way or app (though i'd prefer something local and avoid installing new apps) I don't know? thanks.

To be precise, the download reading of network traffic monitor shows three times the actual download speed (https://imgur.com/a/IPGxiNJ) when using VPN, while the upload reading of network traffic monitor is actually the download speed of WLAN interface (or mobile data interface). You can see the discrepency between PerfMon and network traffic monitor. It seems that network traffic monitor is adding up the download speed of all network interfaces. This is not a problem when not using

We currently have about 25 medical clinics with point to point t1s to most locations. We have started implementing MPLS but those circuits are managed by the ISP, they only provide crap reporting do we would ideally like to monitor those but probably not possible since we have no passwords. So really want to see the load on each t1. We have mostly cisco but dome Adran routers. I am leaning toward what's up gold but haven't used it before.

So I am having an issue at a remote site office where they are saturating their 3.0 bonded T1 line. I am going out there next week to see if I can track down the issue. I was going to hook up a hub and run wire shark and see what I got, however I was thinking, isn't there something better than wire shark that I could use that might say have graphs or be a lot more intuitive than just scrolling through line after line of random code. Maybe compile what IP address is using how much traffic.

Is there a way to track the Network Usage from each device connected? something like this: - open firefox, navigate to website - see connected devices (now connected and unused) - next to the device is the assigned IP and a KB / MB / GB counter, if connected right now maybe even a mb/s counter. if all of this is doable, a graph which shows the usual usage of the device per hour would В данном разделе собраны программы, предназначенные для серфинга в сети интернет, просмотра веб-страниц, чтения новостей в формате.

Works well in all corners and rooms of my house. However, around 9:00pm, if I'm in bed watching a show or movie on my iPad, Netflix stutters every few minutes. Back out, sites take a few minutes to load, apps take longer to download than usual. What I'm looking for is a network traffic monitoring program I can download to run on my main PC (Windows 8). It can be free or paid. I'd like it to be able to monitor any traffic, and tell me what's using traffic Terms: Abbreviations (if any) Производственное объединение эксплуатации компрессорных станций.

Ubuntu 10.04 I'm having so much trouble with this. I had one before on Mint, but my ISP recently upgraded my data usage to 30GB download and 10GB upload. So I would like a GUI application so I can start seeding again. I'm not stupid, but my Google Fu has let me down. (every thing is wlan and the likes, and i had those problems where I changed my /etc/network. bla bla ) Maybe ELI5, so I don't annoy you anymore Thanks. Since most of the time I am using my phone as Wi-Fi Hot Spot for my Notebook and this on a 3GB/month limit, how do you guys track your traffic? With Windows 10 my traffic seems to have gone way up and I am afraid 10 does lots of things in the background - like sending data, updating Windows Store apps, which I never use, or updating Live Tiles like the wheather app. I know, there is an option for metered connection, but I have no clue if it actually changes anything. I would like Windows I want to be able to figure out if my roommate is eating up bandwith watching netflix before I start trying to play games. I tried a couple programs ("net traffic meter" and "network traffic monitor") and neither worked. Is there an easy way to do this over our wireless network.

Hi, I'll be buying new smartphone (S10+ or XS Max 256 GB) and wondering if iOS could do/have: 1. Download any type of file (.zip, jpg, videos, etc.) directly to the phone form Internet 2. Download files directly from NAS 3. Sync photos with Google in background 4. Play downloaded video files with subtitles 5. Play streams (e.g. soccer streams) from webpages 6. Sync Chrome data to Safari and from Safari to Chrome (don't own mac) 7. Play audiobooks from internal memory (downloaded in mp3 format. So discord was working fine for me up until two days ago. I woke up only to find out that I had been signed out of the app and the screen that said "reconnecting" just sat there for ages without actually reconnecting. So I kill the app and re-launch it, only to be met with a screen telling me that my discord installation must be corrupt and that I should fix it. Okay. It redirects me to the discord site to download the latest installer package. I download that, try to install it, all seems. What are the best open source projects for the iPhone platform. (not for a paid service like proton mail btw) things like email, notes, password safes,ftp clients and servers, contacts and calenders (with our with out sync) network traffic monitors,anything that involves encryption.pgp etc. whatever open source you use. looking for open source apps only (not free with paid service or in app purchases to upgrade). Please give me a general idea of what an it coordinator does typically for a high school as opposed to a network admin. 
Checked 14.1 changelog, I found two of most wanted features has been backported to 14.1 and made available from this weeks build: Network speed indicator: Go to Settings -gt StatusBar you will see the "Network traffic monitor" toggle QR code reader in camera app: tap the camera icon besides shutter buffer, you will see the QR code icon which switch to QR mode.

Hi there, It's in the tittle, I have huge freezes during games at random moments, for no reason (my PC isn't the issue, and the internet connection neither with a solid 1GB down and a ping around 3-10 ms, and around 25-50 ingame). But since a couple of patches, I have random freezes that sometimes cost me the fight since I can't avoid some skillshot or use spells when I needed it the most. I have checked that my connection wasn't the issue, and it only happens with HOTS. Sometimes I have a fairly straightforward Unifi network: USG, UAP-AC-PRO, etc. I've also connected a new IoT device that I believe may be attempting to circumvent some of the controls I have on my network. What is the best way to monitor this device's traffic? Ideally I would like to just understand what IPs it is trying to connect to, what is being passed through, and what the USG is dropping. Afterwards I can refine my network to better secure it. Is there an easy way to do this in the Unifi controlle. I'm on a Nexus6P running LineageOS 15.1 nightly. I have an issue I've never seen or heard of before, and I can't even find anything to google to troubleshoot it. Every other time I unlock the phone, the button bar at the bottom of the screen is gone and the screen is unresponsive EXCEPT that I can pull down the statusbar and interact with notifications. Hit the power button, hit it again, boom phone is fine. Hit the power button, hit it again, no button bar and no touch except status I would like to port mirror and analyze traffic from an Ethernet port with wireshark. I have 1 gbps fiber so I cant use one of those cheap 10/100 mbps taps. What is the difference between the 0 dollar sharktap on amazon vs port mirroring on a managed switch netgear 5 port smart managed plus switch?. PC version. This is certain for firestorm but I’m sure same applies to multiplayer. Ran into an annoying player in firestorm random match. Threatened to boot anyone who didn’t do what he said. Sure enough, you can see where this is going.he ended up booting all 3 of us. I checked my own router to see how he did this and discovered the squad ip’s were visible. Edit: Video Proof First video (https://streamable.com/ccy00) shows firestorm matchmaking (random squadmates) before game is found.
